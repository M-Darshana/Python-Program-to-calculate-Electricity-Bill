# Electricity Bill Calculator

This program calculates the electricity bill based on the amount of kWh units consumed. It follows specific charges for different ranges of units.

## Installation

This program is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/), so you need to have Python installed on your system.

## Usage

Run the program by providing the amount of kWh units consumed as input. It will calculate the electricity bill based on the predefined charges.

Example usage:

```bash
python electricity_bill_calculator.py

Example
Input: U = 250
Output: 3500
Explanation:
Charge for the first 100 units – 10100 = 1000
Charge for the 100 to 200 units – 15100 = 1500
Charge for the 200 to 250 units – 20*50 = 1000
Total Electricity Bill = 1000 + 1500 + 1000 = 3500
